numpy-utils
===========

NumPy-Utils contains utilities of numpy.

Right now it continas the following 3 functions.

1. permanent(x):     
        Square Matrix permanent, it would be numpy data or list data.
        Matrix permanent is just same as determinant of the matrix but change -ve
        sign into +ve sign through out its calculation of determinant.


2. nextmax(x, val):  
        Returns the max value next to the top max value of the numpy x.
        If val doesnot passed by user, it returns the second most max value.

3. nextmin(x, val):     
        Returns the min value next to the least min value of the numpy x.
        If val doesnot passed by user, it returns the second lease min value.

In future more utilites will be added.
